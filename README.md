#Why?
Todo lists should not be locked in to a single platform or service; todo lists should be open and editable across all apps, devices and computers. With .todo files, you can have a single list used across various applications on all of your devices. Edit with a text editor, iPhone, PC, Android or Mac app - what you use to edit doesn't matter. .todo files can be stored just like text files. One option is having a single .todo file in your Dropbox, and then using todo apps (more on this to come) to mark things off or add things to the list as you go. This way, everything stays reliably in sync, and you can edit from everywhere.

#What?
.todo files are just like text files; you can edit them in a text editor, web browser, or smartphone app. The details of this editing are left up to the app developer (I am working on my own interpretation of this editing process - stay tuned).

#How
##Syntax
.todo files are formatted a lot like Task Lists in Github Flavoured Markdown. This can probably change when I think about it more.

- [ ] a task list item
- [ ] list _syntax_ required
- [ ] normal **formatting**
- [ ] incomplete
- [x] completed
